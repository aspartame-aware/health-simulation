# Health Impact Simulation Tool

The **Health Impact Simulation Tool** is an interactive project designed to simulate the potential health effects of aspartame consumption over time. This tool provides an educational and visual way to understand the possible long-term impacts based on user-specific input, such as age, weight, and consumption frequency.

## Project Description

This tool uses publicly available scientific data and community-contributed insights to simulate the potential health effects of aspartame consumption. It aims to:
- Educate users about potential risks associated with aspartame.
- Provide personalized simulations based on user inputs.
- Offer a platform for contributors to improve the accuracy of simulations by adding validated scientific data.

The project is open-source and relies on contributions from developers, data scientists, and health professionals to refine its functionality and accuracy.

## Features

- **Interactive User Input**: Users can input their age, weight, daily consumption, and other factors to generate personalized simulations.
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Graphs and charts display potential long-term health impacts based on user data.
- **Scenario Builder**: Users can test "what-if" scenarios by adjusting consumption levels.
- **Community-Contributed Data**: Incorporates the latest research and data submitted by contributors.
- **Exportable Results**: Users can download their simulation results for reference or sharing.

### How to Create the Repository:

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**:
   - Repository Name: `health-impact-simulation-tool`
   - Description: "An interactive tool to simulate the potential health effects of aspartame consumption based on user inputs."
   - Public or Private: Choose **Public** for collaboration.
   - Initialize with a README: You can use this README content.

2. **Set up the repository locally**:
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/health-impact-simulation-tool.git
     ```
   - Add project files like `index.html`, `styles.css`, `scripts.js`, and any necessary assets.
   - Push changes to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial project setup"
     git push origin main
     ```

3. **Enable collaboration features**:
   - Enable **Issues** for feedback and feature requests.
   - Enable **Discussions** for brainstorming and idea sharing.
   - Use labels like `feature`, `bug`, `documentation` to organize contributions.

4. **Add contribution guidelines**:
   - Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to guide contributors.
   - Add a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to ensure a respectful community.

Let me know if you need help with coding the simulation logic, visualizations, or setting up the environment!
